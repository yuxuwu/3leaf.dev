# The 3-Leaf Clover Blog

Hello!

I'm Yu Xuan, and this is my personal website of sorts. There's not a whole lot going on right now, but hopefully it'll be filled out to a plump shape as the months and years roll by.

I'm mostly interested in programming (hence the .dev), game design, and music (a 21st century trifecta if ever there was), but I may post other things too, who knows!

When people think about clovers, they think, oh! the 4 Leaf Clover! It tends to show up more often than the 3 Leaf Clover now that people don't go outside anymore. But! I think the ordinary 3 Leaf Clover is nice too...
